`"Which way is up again?!"`

GyroGame is a game about loosing every touch with reality. (Well, not really... But it might be disorienting)

The alpha version currently only includes one level, but there are many ideas for new content...

<br>

To play this game you need a custom bluetooth controller.

You can find the firmware repository for it here:

This game was developed within two semesters of our Software Engineering class at the DHBW Karlsruhe.

If you want to know more about the development of this game you should know that we posted weekly blog entries during the two semesters.
